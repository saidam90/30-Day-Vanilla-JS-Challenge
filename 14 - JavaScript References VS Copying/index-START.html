      // start with strings, numbers and booleans
      // let age = 100;
      // let age2 = age;
      // console.log(age, age2);
      // age = 200;
      // console.log(age, age2);

      // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ["Wes", "Sarah", "Ryan", "Poppy"];

      // and we want to make a copy of it.
      // players2 = players.slice();
      // console.log(players2);
      // players2[0] = "Saida";
      // console.log(players2);
      // console.log(players);

      // players3 = [...players];
      // console.log(players3);
      // console.log(players);
      // players[0] = "Saida";
      // console.log(players);
      // console.log(players3);

      // const players5 = Array.from(players);
      // console.log(players5);

      // console.log(players);

      // You might think we can just do something like this:

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

      // one way

      // or create a new array and concat the old one in

      // or use the new ES6 Spread

      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };
      // console.log(person);

      // and think we make a copy:
      // const captain = person;
      // console.log(captain);
      // captain.name = "Saida";
      // console.log(captain);
      // console.log(person);

      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
      console.log(cap2);
      console.log(person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const captain = { ...person };
      console.log(captain);

      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
